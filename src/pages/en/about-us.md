### The design that distinguishes THE KITCHEN STUDIO
The need for specialization in the design and production of kitchen and bedroom furniture led to the creation of **THE KITCHEN STUDIO**. We understand that the renovation and design of kitchen furniture require specialized knowledge, as they have to comply with international norms for functionality and ergonomics.

### Experience & Specialization
But beyond design knowledge, experience is required in the renovation process, with awareness of the developments in technology, materials, as well as accessories (drawers, lighting, workbenches, etc.).

### Collaborations & Offers
**THE KITCHEN STUDIO** not only designs and manufactures furniture but also collaborates with Italian furniture houses, thus offering a wide range of proposals to meet any need and budget.

### Visit Our Showroom
The designers of **THE KITCHEN STUDIO** invite you to the specially designed [Showroom](/en/showroom), both the average consumer and the professional architect, interior designer, and engineer, to discuss your needs and provide customized solutions.
